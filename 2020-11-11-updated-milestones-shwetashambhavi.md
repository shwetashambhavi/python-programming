So for this project I had planned to work on the visual first and then add functionalities to it. And so far I have done the following,

1. I plan to include 2 different canvas for this game and os far I have worked up a basic visual for the first one.
2. I also plan to include custom turtle compound shape(house) for this game. For now I have an image in place of compound image.

Next steps will be 
3. Working on the 2nd canvas and option to switch between them 
4. Adding ballons on canvas
5. Enabling balloons to make the house float 
6. Pop feature of the balloon


And for the last I will work on the feature of screen listening through keys.
