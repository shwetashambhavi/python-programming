**Joint Reflection**

This exercise was more of a challenge than the previous pair programming exercise we did. My partner and I (Shweta) didnâ€™t make much progress on the day the assignment was issued. We thus rescheduled to finish the assignment. We started out by splitting the work into driver (Akita) and navigator (Shweta), but due to technical web browser issues, we flipped roles. 

Working with dictionaries in this assignment was tricky because of indexing issues, white spaces, correct sorting, and nested loops. We tried a few techniques and came up with a script we were both happy with. Overall though, it was an a good learning experience to keep working with a fellow programmer on deliverables for this class.
