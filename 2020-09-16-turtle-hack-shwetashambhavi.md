Reflection:

In this exercise I wanted to focus on the visualisation aspect of turtle. It was time consuming and lil frustrating to figure out the directions to make siderwebs and other things I wanted to draw!
So was it was an exciting exercise I learned to intrduced mulltiple turtles into the project and use it to make our canvas!
