Reflection:
This application was specially tricky for me as I have utilised classes and functions in this application and it was interesting to implement program this way.

In the beginning I had few extra features in my milestones which I would still like to do but I'm yet to figure out some features. 
Intitial Milestones included:
1. Color option; done
2. Shape option; [yet to implement[got stuck in adding compound shape to turtle]]
3. Clear scree; done
4. toggle option; [drag and click method; yet to implemet key option]
5. save image; [kept getting errors while implementing]

For now I have drag and click method to draw around the canvas which works well but I would like to add additional options like keys as well.
