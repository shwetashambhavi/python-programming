Reflection:

I built up on the turtle hack post to see if with click events drawing on canvas can get easier.
It was a challenge in the beginning to get familiar with click event and the key events.
But it definitely made it easier to draw with turtle as with this it was easier to track the positions of the turtle. 
One thing I struggled with was using those coordinates appropriately!
