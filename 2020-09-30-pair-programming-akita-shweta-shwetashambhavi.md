Joint Reflection 
This was an interesting exercise for both of us. We both seem to have some background in software, however, it took a little bit to come up with a python script that worked well. I learnt a lot from my partner, Shweta during the process. 
We started out by splitting the work into driver (shweta) and navigator (Akita). We were able to complete the first exercise we attempted (last question on the list). Due to time constraints, we decided to split the work left. We later met to discuss why we made the choices we made, then made a few adjustments to our code and submitted it. 

Overall, it was a great experience, especially, learning to communicate to a fellow programmer about what I would like to be done and finding the right way to communicate it.
