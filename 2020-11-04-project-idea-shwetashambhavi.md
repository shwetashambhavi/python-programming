For my final project, I would like to build a simple game application based on the UP Disney house. The game will have a house on the canvas with a drawn background.
House will start to float when we add balloons to it and it will start going down once we start popping the balloons. 

- [ ] Turtle with House image/ compound shape
- [ ] Drawn canvas for the app
- [ ] Option to add a balloon to the house 
- [ ] option to pop the balloons
- [ ] Floating up/ down of the house
- [ ] Adding more features to ease user interaction like keys and screen option.
